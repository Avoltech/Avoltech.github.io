<p>
Ever wondered what kind of stock investment is done by the most consistent Mutual Funds out there?
<br>
What’s their favourite sector? What’s their favourite stock?
<br>
If yes, then I’ve got some answers for you!
</p>
<br>

<p>
Here is a data analysis report for the 27 most consistent Mutual Funds.
<h2># Getting the data:</h2>
To answer these questions, we need to get some data.<br>
I got the data from <a href="https://www.etmoney.com/mutual-funds/all-funds-listing">https://www.etmoney.com/mutual-funds/all-funds-listing</a>.<br><br>

After writing a selenium python web scrapping bot I was able to get all the details in a csv file.<br>
(Code for the bot can be found on my github repo mentioned below)

<h2># Cleaning and pre-processing data:</h2>
 The cleaning part here focuses on getting rid of the unnecessary characters from the numerical fields. That is getting rid of %, , (comma),  (spaces), 'Crs'. <br><br>

As this data contains list of values you need to pre-process them aswell. <br>
Here is a great blog that explains how to work with lists efficiently in pandas. <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/dealing-with-list-values-in-pandas-dataframes-a177e534f173">https://towardsdatascience.com/dealing-with-list-values-in-pandas-dataframes-a177e534f173</a>.<br><br>

<li>There is a negative correlation between LargeCap Holding vs MidCap and SmallCap holding.
<br>That means, a fund generally tends to be invested in LargeCap (large companies) or in MidCap and SmallCap (relatively smaller companies</li>
